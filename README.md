hearU 🎧🫧  
“Not just what you say — but how you say it.”

hearU is a voice-based emotional insight tool that analyzes both the **content** and **expression** of your speech. It generates empathetic feedback and language-based metrics — helping users understand how they sound, not just what they say.
